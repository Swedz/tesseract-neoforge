## Hooking into Modern Industrialization

Although I am not a dev for [Modern Industrialization](https://github.com/AztechMC/Modern-Industrialization), Tesseract
provides the ability for mods to hook into it rather easily while also avoiding conflicts with other mods.

Refer to [MI_HOOKS.md](MI_HOOKS.md) for further information.

## Registry Holders

There are some relatively basic registry holders provided by Tesseract that are useful for quickly and simply
registering blocks, items, and fluids. The MI Hook system uses the registry holders internally.

Refer to [REGISTRY_HOLDERS.md](REGISTRY_HOLDERS.md) for further information.

## Proxies

Tesseract provides a very simple and quick way to implement proxies that have different load environments.

Refer to [PROXIES.md](PROXIES.md) for further information.

## Behaviors

When you need to supply multiple behaviors for a system and grab them depending on context, the Behavior API has you 
covered.

Refer to [BEHAVIORS.md](BEHAVIORS.md) for further information.
