## Hooking into Modern Industrialization
Although I am not a dev for [Modern Industrialization](https://github.com/AztechMC/Modern-Industrialization), Tesseract provides the ability for mods to hook into it rather easily while also avoiding conflicts with other mods.

Refer to [MI_HOOKS.md](MI_HOOKS.md) for further information.

## Registry Holders
There are some relatively basic registry holders provided by Tesseract that are useful for quickly and simply registering blocks, items, and fluids. The MI Hook system uses the registry holders internally.

Refer to [REGISTRY_HOLDERS.md](REGISTRY_HOLDERS.md) for further information.
